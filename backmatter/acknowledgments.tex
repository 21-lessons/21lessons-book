Thanks to the countless authors and content producers who influenced my thinking
on Bitcoin and the topics it touches. There are too many to list them all, but
I’ll do my best to name a few.

\begin{itemize}
  \item Thanks to Arjun Balaji for the tweet which motivated me to write this.
  \item Thanks to Marty Bent for providing endless food for thought and entertainment. If you are not subscribed to Marty’s Bent and Tales From The Crypt, you are missing out. Cheers Matt and Marty for guiding us through the rabbit hole.
  \item Thanks to Michael Goldstein and Pierre Rochard for curating and providing the greatest Bitcoin literature via the Nakamoto Institute. And thank you for creating the Noded Podcast which influenced my philosophical views on Bitcoin substantially.
  \item Thanks to Saifedean Ammous for his convictions, savage tweets, and writing The Bitcoin Standard

And finally, thank you for reading this. I hope you enjoyed it as much as I did enjoy writing it.
