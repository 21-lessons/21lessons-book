This repository contains the LaTeX source code for the print version of *21
Lessons - What I've Learned from Falling Down the Bitcoin Rabbit Hole*.

## About this book

This is a bit of an unusual book. But hey, Bitcoin is a bit of an unusual
technology, so an unusual book about Bitcoin might be fitting. This book came to
be because of one simple question: *What have you learned from Bitcoin?* I tried
to answer this question in a single tweet. Then the tweet turned into a
tweetstorm. The tweetstorm turned into an article. The article turned into three
articles. Three articles turned into 21 Lessons. And 21 Lessons turned into this
book.
